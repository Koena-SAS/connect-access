# Deployement

The deployement is done with Docker and Docker Compose that package everything needed in containers.

The following are thus needed on the production server:

- Docker Engine v20+
- Docker Compose v2.12+

The two Docker Compose files `staging.yml` and `production.yml` with correctly configured environment variables give the possibility to have completely separate Docker containers and volumes, so that a staging and a production environment can be run on the same machine independently.

:::info

The SSL/TLS encryption is not done in one of the Docker layers of this application, so you will have to do it before the traffic hits the Traefik container entry point.

:::

To start the deployement you need to clone the repository on your server:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/koena/connect-access/connect-access.git
```

## Environment variables

Most of the configuration is done through environment variables that are loaded by Docker Compose from files in `.envs/` folder.

### Create the files

First you need to copy `.envs/production_template/` for production and staging environments:

```bash
cd connect-access
cp -r .envs/production_template .envs/.production
cp -r .envs/production_template .envs/.staging
```

### Fill the values

You have to fill the values for all the 5 configuration files:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="data" label="Data" default>

<dl className="description-list">
  <dt>DATA_PLATFORM_NAME</dt>
  <dd>
    The name of the platform that will appear publicly instead of "Connect
    Access".
  </dd>
  <dt>DATA_PLATFORM_DOMAIN_NAME</dt>
  <dd>The domain name of your website.</dd>
  <dt><span className="large-span">DATA_COMPANY_NAME, </span><span className="large-span">DATA_COMPANY_EMAIL</span></dt>
  <dd>Your company name and email address, used when sending emails.</dd>
  <dt><span className="large-span">DATA_ADMIN_NAME, </span><span className="large-span">DATA_ADMIN_EMAIL</span></dt>
  <dd>
    The name and email of the administrator, to send him/her emails when
    important errors occur.
  </dd>
  <dt>DATA_LOGO_FILENAME</dt>
  <dd>

The name of the main logo in `frontend/src/images/`, with a recommended size of 178 x 80 pixels. If it is your own image, you have to add it there. You can let the default value for this environment variable and add your image at path `frontend/src/images/logo_custom.png`.

  </dd>
  <dt>DATA_LOGO_FILENAME_SMALL</dt>
  <dd>

The name of the small logo in `frontend/src/images/`. This logo is shown in the admin panel when the menu is collapsed, and should be as square.

  </dd>
</dl>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="django" label="Django">

<dl className="description-list">
  <dt>DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</dt>
  <dd>
    The Django settings Python file used. You will probably not need to change
    that.
  </dd>
  <dt>DJANGO_SECRET_KEY</dt>
  <dd>

A secret key that you have to generate for your application. You can take a look at the [Django documentation about this](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECRET_KEY), and you can find a lot of generators on the web.

  </dd>
  <dt>DJANGO_ADMIN_URL</dt>
  <dd>

This is the path of your Django admin panel: `yourdomain.com/[DJANGO_ADMIN_URL]/`. Thanks to this, the django admin panel is more difficult to find by attackers.

  </dd>
  <dt>DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS</dt>
  <dd>

You can put here all the hostnames that are allowed to send requests to the Django server, separated by commas. You should mainly put here your domain names. This is useful to avoid Cross Site Scripting and Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. You can find more information in the [Django Documentation about ALLOWED_HOSTS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts).

  </dd>
  <dt>DJANGO_COOKIE_SECURE</dt>
  <dd>

This setting is only used in the production image, and should always be `True` in a production environment except in specific cases like non secure end to end tests being run.

  </dd>
  <dt>DJANGO_SERVER_EMAIL</dt>
  <dd>The email address that Django will indicate as sender for error messages to admins.</dd>
  <dt><span className="large-span">DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST, </span><span className="large-span">DJANGO_EMAIL_USE_TLS, </span><span className="large-span">DJANGO_EMAIL_PORT, </span><span className="large-span">DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST_USER, </span><span className="large-span">DJANGO_EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD, </span></dt>
  <dd>The email configuration elements you will find from your email service provided.</dd>
  <dt>WEB_CONCURRENCY</dt>
  <dd>

The number of Gunicorn processes spawned to handle requests. You can learn more about this feature on the [Gunicorn documentation](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#worker-processes).

</dd>
  <dt><span className="large-span">SENTRY_DSN, </span><span className="large-span">SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT, </span></dt>
  <dd>

Connect Access is configured to send error logs to Sentry, which is both an open source monitoring tool you can install, and a company running an instance of that tool. The easiest way is to create an account on [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and use the free version to see if this is useful for you. `SENTRY_DSN` is a URL provided when you create an account, and `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` is for configuration, to make a distinction for production and staging logs for example.

</dd>
  <dt>REDIS_URL</dt>
  <dd>In case you would like to use another Redis instance on your server.</dd>
  <dt><span className="large-span">CELERY_FLOWER_USER, </span><span className="large-span">CELERY_FLOWER_PASSWORD, </span></dt>
  <dd>A random user and password for the Flower monitoring tool.</dd>
  <dt>MEDIATION_REQUEST_EMAIL</dt>
  <dd>The email address to which an email will be sent everytime a mediation request is created.</dd>
</dl>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">
<dl className="description-list">
  <dt>COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME</dt>
  <dd>This is the project name used by Docker for all containers and volumes, which can have the same names and still be independent thanks to the differing project name. You have to change this everytime you would like to install an independent version of Connect Access: to have a staging and a production instance on the same machine, but also if you run several production instances.</dd>
</dl>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="postgres" label="Postgres">
<dl className="description-list">

  <dd>These information define the PostgreSQL database information that will be used by the backend.</dd>
  <dt>POSTGRES_DB_END_TO_END</dt>
  <dd>This is the database name used by the end to end tests. It is flushed everytime the tests are run. You will probably not need this if you are simply installing a staging / production server.</dd>
</dl>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="traefik" label="Traefik">
<dl className="description-list">
  <dt>APPLICATION_PORT</dt>
  <dd>The port of the main entry point to the Django application. You will need to redirect the traffic coming to your server there, after handling the SSL/TLS encryption.</dd>
  <dt>FLOWER_PORT</dt>
  <dd>The port of the Flower container. You don't need to change it if you don't use the service.</dd>
</dl>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Create merged files

You can pass only one file containing environment variables to set to `docker compose` so you have to merge these files everytime you change something. This can be done with the following command:

```bash
python merge_production_dotenvs_in_dotenv.py
```

This will create the two files `.env_production` and `.env_staging` that are simply the concatenation of the 5 separate files you configured.

## Build and deploy the application

Everytime you would like to execute a command, you have to specify the correct `docker compose` YAML configuration file and the correct environment variables merged file.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="production" label="Production" default>

```bash
docker compose -f production.yml --env-file .env_production my_command
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="staging" label="Staging">

```bash
docker compose -f staging.yml --env-file .env_staging my_command
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To build and start the application, run the following commands:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="production" label="Production" default>

```bash
docker compose -f production.yml --env-file .env_production build
docker compose -f production.yml --env-file .env_production run django python backend/manage.py migrate
docker compose -f production.yml --env-file .env_production up -d
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="staging" label="Staging">

```bash
docker compose -f staging.yml --env-file .env_staging build
docker compose -f staging.yml --env-file .env_staging run django python backend/manage.py migrate
docker compose -f staging.yml --env-file .env_staging up -d
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The application will start, and listen on the port specified by the `APPLICATION_PORT` environment variable.

The `migrate` command is executed on Django to create initially the database tables.

## Configuration

Once the application is running, you can configure some elements through the Django admin panel that will be available at `yourdomain.com/[DJANGO_ADMIN_URL]/`.

But first you need to create an admin account with the following command (you will need to indicate some basic information like your name, email address and password):

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="production" label="Production" default>

```bash
docker compose -f production.yml --env-file .env_production run django python backend/manage.py createsuperuser
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="staging" label="Staging">

```bash
docker compose -f staging.yml --env-file .env_staging run django python backend/manage.py createsuperuser
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

With the created account you can connect to the admin panel and fill some configuration information :

<dl className="description-list">
  <dt>Information about the organization running the mediation service</dt>
  <dd>

Here you can fill information about your company that will appear on the footer of the Connect Access application, in "Contact us" section.

You can also add your terms of service, that will then appear at `yourdomain.com/terms-of-service`.

  </dd>
  <dt>About mediation service information</dt>
  <dd>

Here you can add links that will appear in the "About" section of the footer. Each entry is one link.

The link's URL have to be either an external absolute URL (beginning with `http` of `https`) that will open a new window, or a relative URL that will not open a new window and not reload the page. If you fill the "Terms of service" page content in contact information section, the page URL you use here should be `terms-of-service`.

  </dd>
  <dt>Sites</dt>
  <dd>In this section, add an entry for your domain name.</dd>
</dl>
