# Connect Access

Connect access is a platform that helps managing mediation accessibility requests, maintained by [Koena](https://koena.net) team.

## Features

- A 4-step form allows disabled users to submit the problem they have on a specific website.
- This mediation request triggers the sending of an email, so that a mediator can connect to the admin panel, see the information and contact the user.
- The mediator can create trace reports for each contact he has with the user or the organization providing the dysfunctional service.
- The user is able to create an account to see his mediation requests.
- When the account is deleted, or when a mediation request is closed, the user personal information are deleted automatically.
