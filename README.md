# Connect Access

Connect access is a platform that helps managing mediation accessibility requests, maintained by [Koena](https://koena.net) team.

## Features

- A 4-step form allows disabled users to submit the problem they have on a specific website.
- This mediation request triggers the sending of an email, so that a mediator can connect to the admin panel, see the information and contact the user.
- The mediator can create trace reports for each contact he has with the user or the organization providing the dysfunctional service.
- The user is able to create an account to see his mediation requests.
- When the account is deleted, or when a mediation request is closed, the user personal information are deleted automatically.

## Documentation

The developer and user documentation is available in the online [Connect Access documentation](https://connectaccess.org/docs/introduction).

## Extended version

A close source extension has been made by Koena to integrate features for partner organizations :

- A specific interface for each partner, with customizable colors, presentation text and logo, and a specific path so that each partner can create a link on his website to redirect to his version of the main mediation request form.
- An orientation page to inform visitors about the mediation service, and let them choose to go to it or contact the partner directly if the request isn't about accessibility.

You can contact us if you are interested by this extension.
